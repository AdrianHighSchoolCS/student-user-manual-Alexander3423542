## Feedback
<p>I prefer to receive feedback: face to face (face to face or in writing or other)</p>
<p>If you are going to correct me: i don't care how you do it(do it privately or do it in front of the class or other)</p>
<p>If you are going to tell me I'm doing something wrong, phrase it this way: i don't care</p>
<p>If you want to praise me: i don't care(do it privately or do it in front of the class or other)</p>
<p>It is important to me that feedback is: no(timely, includes specific examples, is constructive...etc)</p>
